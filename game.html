								<h3>The Project</h3>
								<p>After having learned the basics of programming, I had begun looking into the development of video games. In 2017, I discovered Game Maker Studio, a software with it's own
								built in language that was used for game development. I created several small demo games with the software, simple demos to practice tasks such as creating dialogue boxes or dealing with
							collisions. After I felt I had learned the basics, I moved on to working on a more fleshed out game.</p>
							<p>Alongside my work leading up to this project, I had also been practicing digital art. Pixel art in particular was going to be an important skill for this type of
							project. I would do small pieces in my spare time and slowly improved to a point I was happy with.</p>
							<p>The game itself began with planning. Primarily how the player would move and what type of game it would be at first, with details being fleshed out later. Then I began Programming
							a basic demo version of the game which would feature one area and showcase a majority of the game's main elements.</p>
							<p>The demo game began with simple squares being used for each of the sprites, but has now been updated to use proper pixel sprites with animations for most elements. The demo is
							nearly complete, with a player character that can move around and fire a small futuristic gun, an animated setting, non player characters that have a few different ways of moving around,
						a working inventory and item system, a health system, a camera system for viewing the game screen, and a transition system for transporting the player from room to room.</p>

								<h3>Takeaways</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Learned about hashmaps and got to apply data structures when building the inventory.</li>
									<li>Learned ways of implementing common video game elements such as health systems, movement, and collisions.</li>
									<li>Improved and continue to improve at creating sprites with digital paint software.</li>
									<li>Gained experience in learning a new programming language.</li>
									<li>Gained experience in views, scaling and computer graphics.</li>
								</ul>
