								<h3>The Project</h3>
								<p>Within my Fundamentals of Software Development course at Queens, I was paired with four others and tasked with creating a piece of software over the course of the semster using C++.</p>
								<p>This process began with idea generation, in which several ideas were created. Then the team used a weighted evaluation matrix to determine which idea to go with and after completing it,
								we opted for an auto scrolling platformer game.</p>
								<p>Each of us were also given roles for the project early on in its development. Of these roles, I was tasked with being a programmer and graphical designer. With my previous experience
								creating sprites for video games in the past, I made sure to start creating the game's assets very early on. We decided to make the theme of the game based around programming, with the
							player navigating a robotic looking character through a filesystem filled with bugs, traps and corrupted file obstacles. As soon as this decision was finalized, and we determined what animations
						we would need, I got right to work, creating the sprites during any small period of free time I had in between classes. The sprites were completed well before the bulk of the programming had even started.</p>
						<p>The project was managed using Confluence, Jira, and Bitbucket. With Confluence acting as the area for us to keep meeting notes, our work logs, assets to be shared for the project, the RAD document, and the SDD document.
						Jira was used for setting sprints and assigning tasks to team members, as well as the estimated times it would take to complete those tasks, allowing us to see where we were in the project's timeline.
					Bitbucket was then used for sharing the project's code between all the members. The project used the Qt library, which was probably the greatest mistake our team made, as we found out too
				late in the process that Qt is better for UI type projects as opposed to something along the lines of a platformer game.</p>
				<p>When it came to the programming of the game, I ended up working primarily on the collisions, randomly generating the enemies, the player movement and the random terrain generation.</p>
				<p>The team ran into a fair share of hurdles while developing the program, however, these hurdles were rarely tackled on our own. Even though someone may have been tasked with a section of the program,
				I and my fellow teammates would often help when anyone ran into a problem. In the end, we managed to complete the software to the point that we wanted by the end of the semester, overcoming every one of the issues we ran into.</p>
				<h3>Takeaways</h3>
									<li>Gained experience working in an agile team environment.</li>
									<li>Got several chances to exercise programming problem solving skills.</li>
									<li>Gained experience working with Confluence, Jira, and Bitbucket.</li>
									<li>Gained experience programming in C++ and with using Qt.</li>
									<li>Improved on existing sprite creation skills.</li>
									<li>Learned about creating software design diagrams, such as sequence diagrams.</li>
