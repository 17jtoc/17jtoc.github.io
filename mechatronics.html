								<h3>The Project</h3>
								<p>During the mechatronics course I took in my second year of computer engineering, I was paired with two team members and tasked with building and programming a robot using
								an Arduino and several components provided to us. Over the course of 12 weeks, we were to add the components to the robot and program it to complete a task for a final competition.</p>
								<p>The most notable components included a distance sensor, an IR sensor, bumpers, a claw, line trackers, and a bluetooth module.</p>
								<p>The final competition was a race where our team would need to work with another two teams to have our robots collect a series of dice and bring each of them to a bin
								all at once without colliding with one another.</p>
								<p>In terms of how our robot performed in this competition, I would say it did alright. The robot was able to complete the task on its own, but when paired with the other robots, the small errors
									that each of them had would accumulate and there were a few instances where they needed assistance. One of the greatest hurdles with the project was how precise everything needed to be.
								In order for the robots to function correctly, they needed to perform actions at specific speeds and times and so values would need to be modified to account for this. The issue with that
							was that those values would change depending on the lighting or the charge of the battery. In order to deal with these problems, we added programming to the robots that would help to deal with the error that these issues would cause.
						The main two solutions were a sweep function that would allow the robot to relocate its track by rotating until the line tracker found its mark again if it were to lose it, as well as well
					as a distance sensor on the front which would check for other robots and stop if there was going to be a collision.</p>
								<h3>Takeaways</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Gained experience working with Arduino hardware and programming.</li>
									<li>Got a chance to work together with a team to formulate a strategy and then program it.</li>
									<li>Gained experience with electrical circuitry.</li>
								</ul>
