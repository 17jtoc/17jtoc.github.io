								<h3>The Project</h3>
								<p>The panic attack app was an android application developed over the course of three semesters, a project for my school known as a capstone project. It was created primarily in Android Studio,
								with Figma being used for prototyping, GitHub being used to share code, Microsoft Word being used for reports, and Microsoft Powerpoint being used for presentation. Our team consisted of four members,
							with myself and another responsible for programming, another member in charge of design, and the last one working on wearable hardware to link to the application and read the user's heartrate.</p>
								<p>The first semester was used to learn design tools, come up with an idea and then to prepare for the project itself. This included fleshing out the idea, researching panic attacks as well as
									existing solutions, coming up with a list of goals to split the project into, determining how long each of those goals would take, and deciding who would lead each goal. </p>
								<p>In the second semester, the team started with a focus on design. Flow charts and UML diagrams were created for the functions of the app, then work began on designing a prototype in Figma. As the app was being designed,
								I began working on the actual programming of the completed portions of the design alongside the other programmer on the team. We'd used Android Studio in the past but still spent some time refreshing before
								beginning to work. Once we did start, the other programmer and I would complete assigned portions of the app and upload them to GitHub a little at a time.</p>
								<p>The programming carried over to the third semester, which additional tasks being added based on feedback gathered by the design member of the group. However, even with the additional tasks, the app was completed
								on time with only one goal needing to be pushed back throughout the project's lifespan. A couple screenshots from the finished app are shown above, the main functions of the app were a mood calendar,
								an emergency contacts page, exercises to help the user through a panic attack, and a wearable that could sync with the app and read the user's heartrate.</p>
								<p>The project was never designed around the pandemic situation, however, even with this being the case, the project went well even with everyone working remotely.</p>

								<h3>Takeaways</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Gained experience programming in Android Studio.</li>
									<li>Gained experience creating mobile applications.</li>
									<li>Learned and implemented an SQLite database.</li>
									<li>Gained experience working remotely in a team and collaborating on code with GitHub.</li>
								</ul>
