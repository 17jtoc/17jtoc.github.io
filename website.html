								<h3>The Project</h3>
								<p>My first task after joining Access Technologies was to create their website. On my first day, I was given a list of everything they wanted out of their website and a basic design,
								With that, my job was to complete the necessary research and build a prototype that could meet their requirements.</p>
								<p>Prior to joining Access Tech, my experience in website building was limited to what I had learned at QHacks that year, where I had quickly learned basic HTML and CSS to build
								a less professional looking prototype website hosted from our computers. QHacks took place over the course of a weekend, so this experience, while being a large amount for such a small time
							frame, was not very in depth.</p>
							<p>When it came to creating this site, I started out with the research. I took the list of what they wanted me to do and I watched tutorials until I felt I could do everything on it.
							Once the research was done, I began sketching a simple paper prototype of what each page would look like and where each page would take the user. When that was completed, I began programming.
						</p>
						<p>Once the first version of the website was finished, I met with the chief scientist at Access Tech and we discussed how the site could be improved and what changes they wanted to see. After that,
						I'd take the feedback, modify the site and repeat this process until we reached a point where there wasn't anymore immediate feedback. Though some minor changes were made later as they were
					thought of.</p>
								<h3>Takeaways</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Gained a better understanding of HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript.</li>
									<li>Used design techniques in a proffesional setting.</li>
									<li>Gained a strong understanding of the fundamentals of website development.</li>
									<li>Gained experience working with FileZilla and GoDaddy.</li>
									<li>Learned the importance of continuously improving a product with feedback.</li>
								</ul>
