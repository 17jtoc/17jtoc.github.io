								<h3>The Project</h3>
								<p>After spending a few months learning the basics of Unity, The Monster Part Salesman was the first Unity game I decided to create.</p>
								<p>I spent time creating a plot for the game as well as coming up with the concept before I began work on the artwork. Then while the artwork was being completed, I also came up with new ideas and
								eventually came up with the concept I wanted for the game. It would be a simple puzzle RPG, however the puzzles would be the monsters themselves. The player character would be weaker and slower
								than many of the monsters but would have an array of traps at their disposal in order to analyze the monster's behaviours and movement patterns and then outwit them with the traps.</P>
								<p>The project's design started to become fleshed out by the end of Summer and unfortunately school started and left little time for it. Over the school year I've been doing small amounts of work either
								with the programming or the artwork, but it has been slow up until recently. Now that school is over, work on the game is moving faster and I've been able to be more consistent.
								<p>Currently a demo world has been created, an enemy and the player have been created and movement and coollisions are working properly. Work is currently being focused on combat systems such as health, dealing damage,
								taking damage, knockback, and the trapping mechanics.

								<h3>Takeaways</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Learned about using Unity and gained experience working with the development platform.</li>
									<li>Learned animation in Unity and how to create and use blend trees.</li>
									<li>Improved and continue to improve at sprite work.</li>
									<li>Gained experience working with C#.</li>
								</ul>
